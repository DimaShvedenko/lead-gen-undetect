Before we start working, we need to understand and strategize how and where we will get leads and through which programs and platforms we will communicate with them.

 1 . The availability of paid outreach tools, warming up of emails, and a well-formed ICP.  
2\. When searching for leads through LinkedIn, we need to set up the geography in which we will work in the filters. We also need to set the industry in which we will look for people, and the size of the companies we will view.   
It is possible to search by company accounts and the titles of people in this industry.  
3\. To store these leads somewhere, we add the Snov.io tool to our process. It synchronizes well with LinkedIn and unloads the people you need from it using the Li prospect finder. In Snov.io, you create folders for projects and sheets in which you will specify the search date, the search industry, and the geo. It is also possible to unload leads via bulk in Snov.io. But this is not super effective if we want to make a more personalized approach.  
4\. At the same time, as we are looking for leads, we are preparing email templates to send to customers. It is desirable to have 2-3 templates, which include a cover letter, and 3 more that will come to the client with an interval of 3- 4.5 days each. Why do we need 2-3 email templates to do A/B testing of emails? You need to understand which template, letter, and message work best. Then, we will create a single template that we will use in our emails, whether for drip campaigns or cold emails.  
5\. When we’ve done everything, found the base and created the templates, we need to start our main work. This is where the Reply.io tool comes in.  
We’ll use it to send emails to the people we’ve found. Here, we will insert all the email templates and edit the variables of the “variable” field, which will allow us to take a more personalized approach. We will be able to insert the person’s name, company name, and industry in which they work.  
On top of that, Reply.io provides fantastic statistics on the campaigns we send out via email or LinkedIn.  
6\. We will see the statistics after the first campaign sends out its letters. Then, we will understand which people and job titles respond more often, which ones are ignored, and which emails were better answered.   
We add those interested in the case we present to the CRM system and describe all the fields listed there. Also, in the notes, we transfer our correspondence and set a task for ourselves or for the manager to whom we will transfer the lead.
